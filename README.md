## Smart Mixer
Author: Matthias Marten mm225fv

A small IoT mixer application, with a tailored interface to set an automatic mixing time for converting sucrose (table sugar) into glucose and fructose.

### Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a small IoT mixer application using a Raspberry Pi Pico W controlled via Home Assistant, with local control options through a push button and a potentiometer. The system is designed to mix any content, but a specific Home Assistant interface is tailored to ensure the correct mixing time when sugar, water, and invertase enzyme are combined.

Invertase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose (table sugar) into glucose and fructose. When sugar, water, and invertase are mixed, the enzyme converts the sugar into fructose and glucose. The time required for this conversion depends on the proportions of the ingredients and the temperature, as the activity of invertase is temperature-dependent. The author has this as smaller hobby, making syrup and artificial honey 1 or 2 every year.

The entire process is controlled and monitored through a Home Assistant dashboard, enabling precise control over the mixing parameters and real-time status updates. The dashboard provides real-time updates on mixing status, speed, temperature, and the remaining mixing time, ensuring efficient and accurate mixing.

#### Tech stack used:
* Raspberry Pi Pico W: Microcontroller used for controlling the mixing system and interfacing with sensors and actuators.
* MicroPython: Programming language used to write the firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
* Home Assistant: Open-source platform for managing and automating smart home devices, used to create the control dashboard and manage automation.

* Lovelace UI: Home Assistant's interface for creating custom dashboards.

#### Estimated time to reproduce this project
5h

## Objective 

I chose to build this automated mixing system to streamline the process of making syrup and artificial honey as a hobby. The device serves the purpose of precisely mixing sugar, water, and invertase enzyme, adjusting for optimal reaction times based on real-time temperature data. By automating the mixing process and monitoring it through Home Assistant, I aim to achieve better estimate of the mixing time needed and a easier mixing process. The data collected will provide insights into the optimal conditions for the enzymatic reaction, helping to refine the process and calculation for the mixing time. 

Additionally, this project may inspire others to explore home automation solutions for various tasks, showcasing the potential of integrating smart technology into everyday activities.

### Code

This section highlights the core functionalities of the automated mixing system's code. The system uses MicroPython to control the Raspberry Pi Pico W, and Home Assistant for remote monitoring and control. Below are the essential code snippets and explanations.

#### 1. Setting Up Network and MQTT

The first step is to connect the Pico W to the Wi-Fi network and set up the MQTT client for communication with Home Assistant.

# MQTT broker details
```python 
MQTT_BROKER = '192.168.0.232'
MQTT_USER = 'XXX'
MQTT_PASSWORD = 'XXX'
MQTT_CLIENT_ID = 'pico'

def connect_wifi():
    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    wlan.connect(SSID, PASSWORD)
    while wlan.status() != 3:
        print('Waiting for connection...')
        time.sleep(1)
    print('Connected to WiFi:', wlan.ifconfig())

def connect_mqtt():
    client = MQTTClient(MQTT_CLIENT_ID, MQTT_BROKER, user=MQTT_USER, password=MQTT_PASSWORD)
    client.connect()
    return client

connect_wifi()
client = connect_mqtt()
```
#### 2. Controlling the Motor
The motor is controlled via the L298N motor driver. The following functions turn the motor on and off, and set the speed based on the rotary encoder or Home Assistant input.

# Motor control functions
```python 
def motorOn():
    ena.duty_u16(65535)
    enb.duty_u16(65535)
    in1.value(1)
    in2.value(0)
    in3.value(1)
    in4.value(0)
    client.publish('homeassistant/switch/pico_motor/state', "ON", retain=True)
    print("Motor ON")

def setMotorSpeed(counter):
    speedToMotor = int(65535 * (counter / 10))
    ena.duty_u16(speedToMotor)
    enb.duty_u16(speedToMotor)
    client.publish('homeassistant/sensor/pico_motor_speed/state', str(counter), retain=True)
    print(f"Motor speed set to: {counter} (Steps)")

```
#### 3. Handling MQTT Messages
```python
def sub_cb(topic, msg):
    global counter
    print((topic, msg))
    if topic == b'homeassistant/switch/pico_motor/set':
        if msg == b"ON":
            motorOn()
        elif msg == b"OFF":
            motorOff()
    elif topic == b'homeassistant/number/pico_motor_speed_control/set':
        try:
            counter = int(msg)
            if 0 <= counter <= 10:
                setMotorSpeed(counter)
                print(f"Speed set to: {counter} (MQTT)")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid speed value")

client.set_callback(sub_cb)
client.subscribe('homeassistant/switch/pico_motor/set')
client.subscribe('homeassistant/number/pico_motor_speed_control/set')
```
#### 3. Reading Sensor Data
The DHT11 sensor provides temperature and humidity readings, which are published to Home Assistant for monitoring.
```python
def read_dht11():
    try:
        dht11.measure()
        temp = dht11.temperature()
        hum = dht11.humidity()
        print(f"Temperature: {temp}C, Humidity: {hum}%")
        client.publish('homeassistant/sensor/pico_temperature/state', str(temp), retain=True)
        client.publish('homeassistant/sensor/pico_humidity/state', str(hum), retain=True)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to read from DHT11 sensor:", e)
```
#### 5. Main Loop
The main loop handles the rotary encoder input, button press, sensor readings, and MQTT message checking. It ensures that the system operates continuously and responds to user inputs.
```python
try:
    last_dht11_read_time = time.ticks_ms()
    while True:
        currentStateCLK = clk.value()
        buttonState = button.value()
................
```

### Data Transmission Overview

#### Frequency of Data Transmission:

* Temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor are sent to the MQTT broker every 60 seconds. There is no need to update this more frequent in this application. 

* Motor speed and state updates are published to the MQTT broker whenever they change, ensuring real-time updates.
  
Wireless Protocols:

#### Wi-Fi: 
* The Raspberry Pi Pico W connects to a local Wi-Fi network to communicate with the MQTT broker hosted on a local server (Home Assistant).
  
Transport Protocols:

#### MQTT:
* This lightweight messaging protocol is used for efficient data transmission.
* MQTT is ideal for IoT applications due to its low bandwidth usage and support for persistent connections.

### Presenting the Data

#### Home Assistant Dashboard
There are two Home Assistant dashboard. One for controlling the mixer directly and one for setting the parameters sugar, water and invertase. The home atuomation is then calculating the time and when the user hits the botton "mix" the mixer will start and run untill the time seen is finished. 

* Direct Mixer Control
